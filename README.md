# Interfaces
Interface in java 

A Class that extends abstract class can also use interface and implement them and interface is not a class 
every method in interface is public abstract
we cannot create object of interface
variable inside interfaces are final and static
A class that implements interface should implement all its method
A interface can also extend another interface
